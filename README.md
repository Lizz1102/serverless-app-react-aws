# Description

## Hosting 

I'm using Amplify Hosting to host the app. App URL - https://master.d2qwlx0rc5kbcp.amplifyapp.com/ 

Amplify provides smart, minimum setup Continuous Integration(CI/CD). I've connected my GitHub repository and Amplify has auto-detected default build configuration and has set up a CI/CD pipeline for automatic build, test, and deployment after each commit. 

## How to Run the App Locally
